This is QB64's built-in help system. It's data is based on the QB64 Wiki. In fact, the pages in this build-in help are downloaded copies of the online Wiki and are displayed here in a **simplified** form. It should be obvious, that we can't reproduce the detailed output of a full fledged web browser here, especially tables are a bit too complex to handle it here. However, you can click the cyan colored **View on Wiki** button at any time to open the original online Wiki page in your standard browser.

;Note:As the QB64 Wiki is a vital resource maintained by our community, it might be a good idea to periodically use the **Update All Pages...** command from the **Help** menu to fetch the latest changes done in the online Wiki.
