The [LET](LET) is a useless statement designed by [cavemen](cavemen) when they started programming.


## Syntax

>  **[LET]** variable = expression


## Description

* InlineCodeLET a = 12InlineCodeEnd is the same as InlineCodea = 12InlineCodeEnd, but wastes 4 extra bytes of program space. 

*Notes:* LET is **optional**, it's the only keyword where the **entire keyword** is optional :-)
